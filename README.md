# BuildStarter

**Kickstarter/Fiverr for websites and apps** — a front-end demo.

One unified experience: search and browse requests, create a request (with optional key features), and open any request to see details, propose features, and rate or comment on creator solutions.

- **Browse** — Search, create a request (with expandable “key features to include”), and click any popular request.
- **Request detail** — Existing features, propose new features, solutions from creators (rate 1–5 stars, comment), and “Post a solution” (Figma or demo link).

No data is collected or stored; all actions are UI-only.

## Run the demo

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL shown in the terminal (e.g. http://localhost:5173).
